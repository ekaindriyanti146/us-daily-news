## Introduction
The Gaza Strip has been hit by a series of Israeli airstrikes, resulting in the deaths of 24 people, including women and children. The Israeli military claims that the strikes were in response to attacks by militants on its soldiers.

## Background & Context
The Gaza Strip has been under Israeli blockade since 2007, when Hamas, a Palestinian Islamist group, took control of the territory. The blockade has had a devastating impact on the economy and living conditions in the Gaza Strip, with high levels of poverty and unemployment. The conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants has resulted in the deaths of thousands of people, including civilians, and has caused widespread destruction. The ceasefire that was put in place last year was seen as a significant step towards reducing violence in the region, but the latest incident has raised concerns that the fragile peace may be at risk.

The Israeli military has stated that the strikes were in response to attacks by militants on its soldiers, but Palestinian officials have disputed this claim. The Palestinian health ministry has stated that the dead include women and children, and that many others have been injured. The incident has sparked widespread condemnation, with many countries calling for calm and restraint in the region.

### Historical Context
The conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants has a long and complex history, with roots dating back to the early 20th century. The creation of the state of Israel in 1948 led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, who were forced to flee their homes and seek refuge in neighboring countries. The Gaza Strip, which is home to over 2 million people, has been a focal point of conflict between Israel and Palestinian militants for many years.
