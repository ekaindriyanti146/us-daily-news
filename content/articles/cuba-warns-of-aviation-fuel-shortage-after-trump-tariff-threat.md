## Background & Context

The country's oil supply is already limited, and the **US**'s efforts to restrict its access to fuel have had a significant impact on its economy. **Cuba** has been forced to rely on **Venezuela** for oil, but the **US**'s sanctions on **Venezuela** have made it difficult for **Cuba** to access the fuel it needs.
