## Introduction
In a surprise move, **Donald Trump** announced that he has reached a 'framework' deal on **Greenland**, dropping his previous threat to impose tariffs on **EU** goods.

## Background & Context
The **Greenland** issue has been a point of contention between the **US** and **EU** in recent months, with **Trump**'s initial offer to buy the island from **Denmark** being met with skepticism and even ridicule by **EU** leaders. However, **Trump**'s persistence on the issue has paid off, with **NATO** officials agreeing to work towards a future deal on **Arctic** cooperation. The **Arctic** region is becoming increasingly important for global trade and security, with **China** and **Russia** also vying for influence in the region. As **Trump** noted, "The **Arctic** is a very important region, and we need to make sure that we have a strong presence there."
