The new AirTag features an expanded range and improved findability, making it easier for users to locate their belongings. The device also has a louder speaker, which allows users to hear it more clearly when trying to find it. According to [Apple](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxONjl2RlF1R1pucFNGM2FKeXdZVTNuQ1FfSDhUMXhFTFNOalVNS09heWdpWGlUU1dGdTFXaG5zTzc2YVJGWjM4T0ktMXA3cklEVUtiS01NZWdOa1lLd2VybE5CUW5WSDJfRmFnQXpqWm05dkJudnNFRVQxa1NwLVBHSTNrdEpDNERvdTdkUnBzUUUwWmJ6S0x1WnIyd09BYlloS3BtMjc4akNsUG9TWUp0aHJB), the new AirTag is designed to provide a more seamless and efficient experience for users.

## Background & Context
The original AirTag was released in 2021 and quickly gained popularity among users who wanted to track and locate their lost items. However, the device had some limitations, including a limited range and a relatively quiet speaker. Over the years, users have been requesting upgrades and improvements to the device, including the addition of a keyring hole. Despite these requests, Apple has only now released an upgraded version of the AirTag, which addresses some of the concerns and limitations of the original device. As reported by [WIRED](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE1VODk1MUpsNmpsS2pOLXNQM2liUnFfYXlHNFlXdDVXN1IxbjlsOGVXRmRfazlBV2FKZG9Xa2RQM0dRYTJoQU5mS1hMMnRGQW9DX2w2UW5udXR6OG1OMU9tbGpGNVBpb0dzb2pjaW9PaHJRQQ?oc=5), the new AirTag is a significant improvement over the original device.

### Technical Specifications

* Louder speaker: up to 90 decibels
* Improved findability: uses a combination of Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS to locate the device
* Water-resistant: IP67 rating

## Analysis
