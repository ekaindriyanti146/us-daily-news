## **Background & Context**

However, a number of women have come forward to accuse Prince Andrew of having sex with them when they were underage, and the prince has been criticized for his association with Epstein.

The investigation into Epstein's activities has been ongoing for several years, and a number of high-profile individuals have been implicated.
