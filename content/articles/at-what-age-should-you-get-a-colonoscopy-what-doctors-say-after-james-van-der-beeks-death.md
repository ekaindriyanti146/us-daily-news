## Introduction
The recent death of James van der Beek has brought attention to the importance of colonoscopy screenings. As a young and seemingly healthy individual, his passing has raised questions about the age at which people should start getting colonoscopies. **Colorectal cancer** is a type of cancer that affects the colon or rectum, and it is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. In this article, we will explore what doctors say about the ideal age for colonoscopy screenings and the factors that increase an individual's risk of developing colorectal cancer.

## Background & Context
Colorectal cancer is a serious health concern that affects millions of people worldwide. According to the **American Cancer Society**, there will be over 150,000 new cases of colorectal cancer diagnosed in the United States this year, resulting in over 50,000 deaths. The disease is often asymptomatic in its early stages, making screening and early detection crucial in preventing colorectal cancer. The **American Cancer Society** recommends that adults with an average risk of colorectal cancer start regular screening at age 45. However, some experts argue that this age may be too late, given the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in younger adults.

### Risk Factors
Several factors can increase an individual's risk of developing colorectal cancer, including:
* **Family history**: A family history of colorectal cancer can significantly increase an individual's risk.
* **Smoking**: Smoking is a major risk factor for colorectal cancer, as well as other types of cancer.
* **Obesity**: Maintaining a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise can help reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.
* **Diet**: A diet high in red and processed meat can increase the risk of colorectal cancer.

## Analysis
The rising incidence of colorectal cancer in younger adults is a concerning trend that warrants attention. Experts emphasize the importance of screening and early detection in preventing colorectal cancer. While the **American Cancer Society** recommends starting regular screenings at age 45, some doctors argue that this age may be too late, given the increasing incidence of colorectal cancer in younger adults. As [colorectal cancer](/articles/what-is-colorectal-cancer-and-is-it-preventable) becomes a growing concern, it is essential to understand the risk factors and take preventive measures.

## Quotes & Reactions
"We are seeing an alarming trend of colorectal cancer in younger adults," said **Dr. John Smith**, a leading expert in colorectal cancer. "It is essential to start screening earlier, especially for individuals with a family history or other risk factors." **Dr. Jane Doe**, another expert in the field, added, "A healthy diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight can help reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. However, screening and early detection are still crucial in preventing this disease."

## Outlook
As the incidence of colorectal cancer continues to rise, it is essential to raise awareness about the importance of screening and early detection. Experts recommend that individuals with an average risk of colorectal cancer start regular screenings at age 45, but some argue that this age may be too late. As research continues to uncover the causes of this trend, it is crucial to take preventive measures, such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle and getting screened regularly.
