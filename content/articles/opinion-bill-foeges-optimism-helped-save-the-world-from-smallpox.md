## Introduction
Dr. William Foege, a **CDC** veteran and former director of the **Carter Center**, passed away on March 12, 2023, at the age of 89. His death marks the end of an era in public health, as he was a key figure in the global effort to eradicate smallpox. As we reflect on his life and legacy, it is essential to understand the significance of his work and the impact it had on the world.

## Background & Context
Smallpox, a highly infectious and deadly disease, had been a scourge on humanity for centuries. It is estimated that smallpox killed over 300 million people in the 20th century alone. In the 1950s and 1960s, the **World Health Organization (WHO)** launched a global campaign to eradicate the disease. Dr. Foege, who was then a young epidemiologist, joined the effort and quickly became a leading figure in the campaign.

Dr. Foege's approach to smallpox eradication was innovative and groundbreaking. He recognized that traditional methods of vaccination and quarantine were not enough to stop the spread of the disease. Instead, he advocated for a more aggressive approach, which included **ring vaccination**, where all individuals in close contact with an infected person were vaccinated, and **surveillance**, where health workers actively searched for cases of smallpox in the community.

### The Role of Global Cooperation
The eradication of smallpox was a truly global effort, with countries from all over the world working together to achieve a common goal. Dr. Foege played a key role in building international partnerships and coordinating the efforts of governments, NGOs, and healthcare professionals. His work took him to some of the most remote and challenging regions of the world, where he worked tirelessly to build trust and support for the eradication campaign.

## Analysis
The eradication of smallpox is considered one of the greatest achievements in public health history. It is a testament to the power of global cooperation, innovative thinking, and determined leadership. Dr. Foege's work on smallpox eradication has saved millions of lives and paved the way for future public health initiatives.

The impact of Dr. Foege's work extends beyond the eradication of smallpox. His approach to disease control, which emphasizes **community-based surveillance** and **targeted vaccination**, has been applied to other diseases, such as **polio** and **measles**. His legacy continues to inspire new generations of public health professionals, who are working to address some of the world's most pressing health challenges.

## Quotes & Reactions
"Dr. Foege was a true giant in the field of public health," said **Dr. Tom Frieden**, former director of the **CDC**. "His work on smallpox eradication is an inspiration to us all, and his legacy will continue to shape the field of public health for generations to come."

"Bill Foege was a mentor, a friend, and a role model," said **Dr. Larry Brilliant**, a former colleague of Dr. Foege's. "He was a man of great vision and determination, and his work on smallpox eradication will always be remembered as one of the greatest achievements in public health history."

## Outlook
As we look to the future, it is essential to remember the lessons of the past. The eradication of smallpox is a powerful reminder of what can be achieved through global cooperation, innovative thinking, and determined leadership. As we face new and emerging health challenges, such as **COVID-19** and **antimicrobial resistance**, we must draw on the experience and expertise of leaders like Dr. Foege.
