## Background & Context
The Chargers' defense has been a major concern for the team in recent years. Despite having a talented roster, the team has struggled to find consistency on the defensive side of the ball. The hiring of **Jesse Minter** as defensive coordinator was seen as a positive move, but his departure to become the head coach of the **Ravens** has left a void that needs to be filled. **Aubrey Pleasant**, with his experience as an assistant head coach with the **Rams**, is seen as an ideal candidate to take over the defensive coordinator position.

The **Rams** have been one of the top teams in the **NFL** in recent years, and Pleasant has been a key part of their success. He has worked closely with **Rams** head coach **Sean McVay** to develop a defense that is both aggressive and disciplined. Pleasant's experience and expertise make him an attractive candidate for the Chargers, who are looking to build a strong defense that can compete with the best teams in the league.

## Analysis
The hiring of **Aubrey Pleasant** as defensive coordinator would be a significant move for the **Chargers**. It would bring a level of experience and expertise to the position that has been lacking in recent years. Pleasant's ability to develop and implement effective defensive schemes would be a major asset to the team, and his experience working with **Sean McVay** would be invaluable in helping the Chargers to build a strong defense.

Moreover, the hiring of Pleasant would also be a positive move for the team's players. The Chargers have a talented roster, but they have struggled to find consistency on the defensive side of the ball. With Pleasant at the helm, the team would have a defensive coordinator who can help them to reach their full potential and compete with the best teams in the league.
