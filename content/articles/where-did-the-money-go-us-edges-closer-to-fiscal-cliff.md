## Introduction
The United States is facing a looming fiscal cliff, with the national debt projected to reach unprecedented levels in the coming years. The **Congressional Budget Office (CBO)** has released a report showing that the national debt will spiral out of control by 2035, with some estimates suggesting it will reach $30 trillion. This has raised concerns among experts and lawmakers, who warn that the fiscal cliff could have severe consequences for the US economy. In this article, we will examine the causes of the fiscal cliff, the potential consequences, and what can be done to address the issue.

## Background & Context
The fiscal cliff is not a new issue, but it has been exacerbated by recent events. The **Trump administration's** tariff policies have led to a significant increase in the national debt, with some estimates suggesting that the tariffs have added over $1 trillion to the debt. Additionally, the **COVID-19 pandemic** has led to a significant increase in government spending, which has further contributed to the fiscal cliff. The CBO report shows that the national debt will reach 107% of GDP by 2035, which is higher than it has been at any point in US history.

### The Role of the CBO
The **CBO** plays a crucial role in assessing the US economy and providing projections for the national debt. The CBO report is based on current laws and policies, and it provides a snapshot of the US economy over the next decade. The report shows that the federal deficit will surge in the coming years, with some estimates suggesting it will reach $1 trillion. This has raised concerns among experts, who warn that the fiscal cliff could have severe consequences for the US economy.

## Analysis
The fiscal cliff is a complex issue, and it requires a comprehensive solution. Experts warn that the fiscal cliff could have severe consequences for the US economy, including higher interest rates and reduced government spending. This could lead to a slowdown in economic growth, which could have far-reaching consequences for businesses and individuals. The **Federal Reserve** has already taken steps to address the issue, by raising interest rates to combat inflation. However, more needs to be done to address the underlying causes of the fiscal cliff.

### The Impact on US Citizens
The fiscal cliff will have significant implications for US citizens. Higher interest rates could lead to increased borrowing costs, which could make it more difficult for individuals and businesses to access credit. Reduced government spending could also lead to a reduction in public services, which could have a significant impact on vulnerable populations. Additionally, the fiscal cliff could lead to a reduction in economic growth, which could lead to higher unemployment and reduced economic opportunities.

## Quotes & Reactions
Experts have warned about the dangers of the fiscal cliff, and the need for a comprehensive solution. **Treasury Secretary Bessent** has stated that the fiscal cliff is a "serious issue" that requires immediate attention. **Marco Rubio** has also warned about the dangers of the fiscal cliff, stating that it could have "severe consequences" for the US economy. Additionally, **Yoon Suk Yeol** has stated that the fiscal cliff is a "global issue" that requires international cooperation to address.

## Outlook
The fiscal cliff is a complex issue, and it requires a comprehensive solution. The US government needs to take immediate action to address the underlying causes of the fiscal cliff, including reducing government spending and increasing revenue. This could involve a combination of tax reforms, spending cuts, and other measures to reduce the national debt. Additionally, the US government needs to work with international partners to address the global implications of the fiscal cliff. By taking a comprehensive approach, the US can reduce the risk of a fiscal cliff and ensure a stable and prosperous economy for future generations.
