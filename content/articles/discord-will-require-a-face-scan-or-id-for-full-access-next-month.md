* **Discord** will introduce a face scan or ID requirement for full access to its platform next month.
* The move aims to enhance child safety and age verification on the platform.
* Users who do not comply with the new requirement will be restricted to a teen account.

## Introduction
In a significant update to its platform, **Discord** has announced that it will require users to undergo a face scan or provide a government-issued ID for full access to its services starting next month. This move is part of the company's efforts to improve child safety and age verification on its platform. The new requirement will affect all users, and those who do not comply will be moved to a teen account with limited features.

The announcement has sparked a mix of reactions from users, with some expressing concerns about privacy and others welcoming the move as a necessary step to ensure a safer environment for minors. As the update is set to roll out next month, users are advised to prepare for the changes and understand the implications of the new requirement.

## Background & Context
**Discord** has been under scrutiny in recent years over concerns about child safety and age verification on its platform. The company has faced criticism for not doing enough to prevent minors from accessing mature content and engaging in inappropriate activities. In response to these concerns, **Discord** has been working to improve its age verification processes and enhance child safety features.

The introduction of face scan or ID requirement is a significant step in this direction. The company believes that this move will help to prevent minors from accessing mature content and reduce the risk of online harassment and exploitation. **Discord** has also announced that it will use the collected data to improve its age verification processes and ensure that users are accessing content that is appropriate for their age group.

### How it Works
The face scan or ID requirement will work by prompting users to provide a government-issued ID or undergo a face scan to verify their age. The process will be facilitated through a third-party service, which will collect and verify the user's data. Once the user's age is verified, they will be granted full access to **Discord**'s features and services.

## Analysis
The introduction of face scan or ID requirement on **Discord** has significant implications for users, particularly minors. While the move is intended to enhance child safety and age verification, it also raises concerns about privacy and data protection. Users may be hesitant to provide sensitive information, such as government-issued IDs or facial recognition data, due to concerns about how the data will be used and protected.

However, **Discord** has assured users that the collected data will be stored securely and in compliance with relevant data protection regulations. The company has also announced that it will provide users with options to opt-out of the face scan or ID requirement, although this may result in limited access to its features and services.

## Quotes & Reactions
"We believe that this move is a necessary step to ensure a safer environment for minors on our platform," said a **Discord** spokesperson. "We understand that some users may have concerns about privacy and data protection, but we assure them that we are committed to storing and protecting their data in a secure and responsible manner."

Users have expressed mixed reactions to the announcement, with some welcoming the move as a necessary step to enhance child safety. "I think this is a great move by **Discord**," said one user. "As a parent, I want to ensure that my child is safe online, and this move will help to prevent minors from accessing mature content."

However, others have expressed concerns about privacy and data protection. "I'm not comfortable providing my ID or undergoing a face scan," said another user. "I understand that **Discord** wants to enhance child safety, but I think there are other ways to achieve this without compromising user privacy."

## Outlook
The introduction of face scan or ID requirement on **Discord** is a significant development in the company's efforts to enhance child safety and age verification. As the update is set to roll out next month, users can expect to see significant changes to the platform's features and services.

While the move has sparked controversy and debate, **Discord** remains committed to its goal of creating a safer environment for minors. As the company continues to evolve and improve its age verification processes, users can expect to see further updates and developments in the coming months.
