## Introduction
Measles is a highly contagious disease that was once thought to be eliminated in the US. However, in recent years, there has been a resurgence of the disease, with cases reported in several states. The outbreak has raised concerns about the effectiveness of vaccination and the potential risks of the disease. In this article, we will explore the causes of the measles outbreak, the risks of the disease, and what you can do to protect yourself and your loved ones.

The measles outbreak has been linked to a combination of factors, including low vaccination rates in some communities and the spread of misinformation about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. According to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/), measles is a highly contagious disease that can spread quickly in areas with low vaccination rates. The disease is caused by a virus that is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

## Background & Context
Measles is a disease that was once common in the US, but it was largely eliminated through vaccination efforts. However, in recent years, there has been a resurgence of the disease, with cases reported in several states. The outbreak has been linked to a combination of factors, including low vaccination rates in some communities and the spread of misinformation about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.

According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/), measles is a highly contagious disease that can spread quickly in areas with low vaccination rates. The disease is caused by a virus that is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, and a rash that spreads across the body.

The measles vaccine is highly effective in preventing the disease, but it is not 100% effective. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/), two doses of the measles vaccine are about 97% effective in preventing measles. However, some people may still get the disease even if they are vaccinated.

### Measles Vaccine Effectiveness
The measles vaccine is highly effective in preventing the disease, but it is not 100% effective. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/), two doses of the measles vaccine are about 97% effective in preventing measles. However, some people may still get the disease even if they are vaccinated.

### Measles Complications
Measles can have serious complications, especially in young children and people with weakened immune systems. According to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/), complications of measles can include ear infections, pneumonia, and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). In rare cases, measles can be fatal.

## Analysis
The measles outbreak has significant implications for public health in the US. The disease can have serious complications, especially in young children and people with weakened immune systems. The outbreak has also raised concerns about the effectiveness of vaccination and the potential risks of the disease.

According to [Dr. Anthony Fauci](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/about/director), Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, "Measles is a highly contagious disease that can spread quickly in areas with low vaccination rates. The disease can have serious complications, especially in young children and people with weakened immune systems."

The measles outbreak has also raised concerns about the spread of misinformation about the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. According to [Dr. Peter Hotez](https://www.bcm.edu/research/faculty/profiles/hotez-peter), Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, "The spread of misinformation about vaccines is a significant public health concern. Vaccines are safe and effective, and they are the best way to prevent the spread of diseases like measles."

## Quotes & Reactions
The measles outbreak has sparked a range of reactions from experts and officials. According to [Dr. Robert Redfield](https://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/leaders/robert-r-redfield.html), Director of the CDC, "Measles is a highly contagious disease that can spread quickly in areas with low vaccination rates. We urge all parents to ensure that their children are up to date on their vaccinations, including the measles vaccine."
