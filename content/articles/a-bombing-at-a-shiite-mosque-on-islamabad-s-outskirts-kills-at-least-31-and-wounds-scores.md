## Background & Context
Pakistan has a long history of sectarian violence, with minority groups such as Shiites, Christians, and Hindus often being targeted by extremist groups. The country has seen a surge in violent incidents in recent years, including bombings, shootings, and kidnappings. The Pakistani government has struggled to combat the threat, with many critics arguing that it has not done enough to tackle the root causes of extremism.

The bombing at the Shiite mosque is the latest in a series of attacks targeting minority groups in Pakistan. In recent years, the country has seen a number of high-profile attacks on minority groups, including the bombing of a Christian church in Lahore and the kidnapping of a Hindu girl in Sindh.

### Historical Context
Pakistan's sectarian violence has its roots in the country's complex history and politics. The country was created in 1947 as a homeland for Muslims, but it has struggled to define its identity and reconcile its Muslim and secular traditions. The country has seen numerous periods of military rule, and its politics have often been marked by violence and instability.
