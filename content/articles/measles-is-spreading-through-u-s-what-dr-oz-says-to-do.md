## Introduction
The US is currently experiencing a significant outbreak of measles, a highly contagious and potentially life-threatening disease. According to recent reports, the number of measles cases has increased substantially in recent months, with many cases reported in various parts of the country. **Dr. Oz**, a renowned health expert, has joined other health officials in urging Americans to get vaccinated to prevent further spread of the disease. In this article, we will delve into the current measles outbreak, its causes, and the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of the disease.

## Background & Context
Measles is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus that can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The disease can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, cough, runny nose, and a characteristic rash. While measles is typically not life-threatening, it can lead to serious complications, such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and even death, especially in young children and individuals with weakened immune systems. The current outbreak is attributed to a combination of factors, including low vaccination rates in certain communities and the spread of misinformation about vaccine safety.

### History of Measles in the US
Measles was once a common disease in the US, with thousands of cases reported each year. However, with the introduction of the measles vaccine in the 1960s, the number of cases declined significantly. In 2000, the US was declared to have eliminated measles, with no continuous transmission of the disease for over 12 months. However, in recent years, the disease has made a comeback, with outbreaks reported in various parts of the country.

## Analysis
The current measles outbreak highlights the importance of maintaining high vaccination rates to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. The measles vaccine is highly effective, with a success rate of over 97%. However, some communities have low vaccination rates, which can put individuals and the wider community at risk. **Dr. Oz** and other health officials are urging Americans to get vaccinated, especially if they have not already done so. This is particularly important for individuals who are at a higher risk of contracting and spreading the disease, such as young children, pregnant women, and individuals with weakened immune systems.

## Quotes & Reactions
"We need to take action to prevent further spread of the disease," said **Dr. Oz**. "The measles vaccine is safe and effective, and I urge all Americans to get vaccinated if they have not already done so." Other health officials have also weighed in on the issue, emphasizing the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. "Vaccination is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of diseases like measles," said a spokesperson for the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**. "We urge all Americans to get vaccinated and to encourage their friends and family to do the same."

## Outlook
The current measles outbreak is a wake-up call for Americans to take action to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. By getting vaccinated, individuals can not only protect themselves but also their communities. **Dr. Oz** and other health officials will continue to urge Americans to get vaccinated, and it is likely that the government will take steps to address the issue, such as increasing funding for vaccination programs and launching public awareness campaigns. As the situation continues to evolve, it is essential for Americans to stay informed and take action to protect themselves and their communities.
