## Key Takeaways
* **NASA** is planning to send humans around the Moon in early March as part of its **Artemis II** mission.
* The mission will be the first to send humans to the Moon since the **Apollo** era.
* The spacecraft will be powered by a fuel that is notorious for leaking, but **NASA** believes it is the best option for the mission.
* The mission will pave the way for future human missions to the Moon and beyond.
* **NASA** has conducted several tests to prepare for the mission, including a recent fueling test that concluded with no major problems.

## Introduction
In a historic move, **NASA** is targeting early March to send humans back around the Moon as part of its **Artemis II** mission. This mission marks a significant milestone in **NASA**'s plans to return humans to the Moon and eventually send them to Mars. The **Artemis II** mission will be the first to send humans to the Moon since the **Apollo** era, and it will pave the way for future human missions to the Moon and beyond. According to **NASA**, the mission is scheduled to launch on March 6, and it will carry four astronauts to the Moon on a lunar flyby mission.

## Background & Context
The **Artemis II** mission is part of **NASA**'s larger **Artemis** program, which aims to return humans to the Moon by 2025 and establish a sustainable presence on the lunar surface. The program also includes plans to send the first woman and the first person of color to the Moon. The **Artemis II** mission will be crewed by four astronauts who will fly on the **Orion** spacecraft, which is powered by the **Space Launch System (SLS)** rocket. The mission will test the capabilities of the **Orion** spacecraft and the **SLS** rocket, and it will provide valuable insights into the challenges of sending humans to the Moon.

### The Fueling Test
One of the major challenges facing **NASA** is the fuel that will power the **Orion** spacecraft. The fuel, known as liquid hydrogen, is notorious for leaking, and **NASA** has experienced several leaks during testing. However, **NASA** believes that the fuel is the best option for the mission, and it has taken steps to mitigate the risks associated with it. Recently, **NASA** conducted a fueling test that concluded with no major problems, which has given the agency confidence in its ability to fuel the spacecraft safely.

## Analysis
The **Artemis II** mission is a significant step forward for **NASA** and the US space program. The mission will demonstrate the capabilities of the **Orion** spacecraft and the **SLS** rocket, and it will provide valuable insights into the challenges of sending humans to the Moon. The mission will also pave the way for future human missions to the Moon and beyond, including a planned mission to Mars in the 2030s. For US citizens, the mission is a source of pride and a reminder of the country's leadership in space exploration. It also has significant implications for the US economy and national security, as it will help to establish the US as a leader in the global space industry.

## Quotes & Reactions
"We are excited to be moving forward with the **Artemis II** mission, and we are confident that it will be a success," said **NASA Administrator Bill Nelson**. "This mission is a significant step forward for **NASA** and the US space program, and it will pave the way for future human missions to the Moon and beyond." **Dr. Thomas Zurbuchen**, **NASA**'s Associate Administrator for the Science Mission Directorate, added, "The **Artemis II** mission is a critical step in our plans to return humans to the Moon and establish a sustainable presence on the lunar surface. We are proud to be a part of this historic mission and to be working with our international partners to achieve our goals."

## Outlook
The **Artemis II** mission is scheduled to launch on March 6, and it will carry four astronauts to the Moon on a lunar flyby mission. The mission will test the capabilities of the **Orion** spacecraft and the **SLS** rocket, and it will provide valuable insights into the challenges of sending humans to the Moon. **NASA** is confident that the mission will be a success, and it is already planning for future human missions to the Moon and beyond. As the US space program continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see more historic missions like **Artemis II**, and **NASA** will remain at the forefront of space exploration.
