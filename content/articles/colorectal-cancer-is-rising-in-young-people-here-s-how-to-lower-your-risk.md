## Introduction
Colorectal cancer, also known as colon cancer, is a type of cancer that affects the large intestine (colon) and rectum. It is one of the most common types of cancer in the United States, with over 150,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Recently, there has been a concerning trend of increasing cases of colorectal cancer among young people, with adults under 50 being diagnosed at a higher rate than ever before. This trend has raised concerns among health experts, who are working to understand the causes and develop effective prevention and treatment strategies. According to [ScienceAlert](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxPTGhpcDJ6RzJLS2xjU1pNb3NfSDFJcGN3aUJFZlpNRE5lekhuY1Vvb0lqWTYycmJ5Q1lyNzBxNEsza05wb2pUUVl5OGJHOThlZTRCSVhoZk40MDhXUU96UHc0UnRZdXJRNVEwYXNCbFVJcTI2SVJRc0ZQaHFOelZPaWxudkJud2t6d1FKTElLX3U0TXYzSXA0dmRwcklGZ01iTGlz?oc=5), the rising cases of colorectal cancer in young people is a pressing concern.

## Background & Context
Colorectal cancer is a complex disease that is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. While the exact causes of the increasing trend of colorectal cancer in young people are not yet fully understood, research suggests that **diet**, **physical activity**, and **smoking** may play a significant role. A diet high in processed meat, sugar, and saturated fat, and low in fiber, fruits, and vegetables, has been linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Additionally, a sedentary lifestyle and smoking have been shown to increase the risk of developing the disease. As reported by [NBC News](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxOQ3JxbF9uMUU5alhXUHN5dUxuYVE4NDlfRDF6OW1XRmVfcmplTFdWSERtdkh3VU5WTERoWW1nUThieVlEUzZaNHdOZ3NRdFZ3R1R5MHYwbW96UU5HbTVRVndUUXlkOTluLW1CTVpRcWVLLXc4WWVUVUF1NHA5M2VrU2Q2QXU1T2c0LWlsTjFYT3Q2UzA5SjJxNXB0YWJOb3FxRGMyZ25jekVjeTVMakVN?oc=5), the American Cancer Society recommends that adults aged 45 and older undergo regular colorectal cancer screening.
