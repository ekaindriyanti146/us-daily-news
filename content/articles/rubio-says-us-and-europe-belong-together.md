## Background & Context
The US-Europe relationship has been a cornerstone of international relations for decades. The two entities have a long history of cooperation on issues such as trade, security, and human rights. However, in recent years, the relationship has faced challenges, including disagreements over trade policies, security issues, and climate change. The **Trump administration**'s decision to withdraw from the **Iran nuclear deal** and impose tariffs on European goods have also strained the relationship. Despite these challenges, the US and Europe continue to share a strong bond, with many Europeans looking to the US as a partner and ally.

### Historical Context
The US-Europe relationship has its roots in the post-World War II era, when the US played a key role in rebuilding Europe through the **Marshall Plan**. Since then, the two entities have worked together on a range of issues, including the creation of the **European Union** and the **NATO** alliance. The US and Europe have also cooperated on issues such as counter-terrorism, non-proliferation, and human rights.

## Analysis
Rubio's statement that the US and Europe "belong together" is significant, as it highlights the importance of the relationship between the two entities. The Secretary of State's comments also reflect the changing nature of the US-Europe relationship, with the US seeking to reassert its influence in the region. However, Rubio's message to Europe has also been viewed as a warning, with some interpreting it as a threat to abandon the relationship if Europe does not change its ways.

## Outlook
