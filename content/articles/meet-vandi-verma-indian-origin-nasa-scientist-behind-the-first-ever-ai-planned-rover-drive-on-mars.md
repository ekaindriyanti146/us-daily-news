## Introduction
On a historic day for space exploration, **NASA's Perseverance Rover** completed its first AI-planned drive on Mars, marking a significant milestone in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics. The drive, which was planned using an AI system called **Claude**, demonstrated the potential for autonomous decision-making in space missions. Who is behind this groundbreaking achievement? **Vandi Verma**, an Indian-origin NASA scientist, played a crucial role in the development of the AI system used for the rover's drive. When did this happen? The drive took place on a Martian day, with the rover navigating through a challenging terrain. Where did it happen? The drive occurred in the **Jezero Crater**, a 45-kilometer-wide impact crater on Mars. Why is this significant? The success of this drive demonstrates the potential for AI to play a significant role in future space missions, enabling autonomous decision-making and increased efficiency.

## Background & Context
The **Perseverance Rover** is part of **NASA's Mars Exploration Program**, which aims to explore the Martian surface and search for signs of past or present life on the Red Planet. The rover, which was launched in July 2020, is equipped with a range of scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and a robotic arm. The rover's primary mission is to explore the **Jezero Crater**, which is believed to have been home to a lake billions of years ago. The crater is thought to have been a potential habitat for life, and the rover's mission is to search for signs of past or present life on Mars. The use of AI in space missions is not new, but the success of the Perseverance Rover's AI-planned drive marks a significant milestone in the development of autonomous systems for space exploration.
