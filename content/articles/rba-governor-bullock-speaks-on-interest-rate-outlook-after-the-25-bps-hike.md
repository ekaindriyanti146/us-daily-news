The RBA's decision to raise the cash rate is aimed at curbing inflation and bringing it back within the target range.

The RBA's move has been influenced by the actions of other central banks around the world.

The **European Central Bank** has also raised interest rates, and the **Bank of England** has hinted at further rate hikes. The global economy is experiencing a period of high inflation, and central banks are taking action to curb it.

## Analysis

The move is expected to have a positive impact on the **Australian dollar**, which has been under pressure in recent months.

The decision will also have an impact on **Australian consumers**, who will face higher interest rates on their mortgages and credit cards.
