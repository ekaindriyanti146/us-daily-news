## Introduction
In a recent statement, **Donald Trump**, the former President of the United States, warned the UK that it is 'very dangerous' to deal with **China**. The warning comes as **Keir Starmer**, the UK Labour leader, visits **China** to strengthen trade ties between the two countries. **Trump**'s statement has sparked a debate about the risks and benefits of dealing with **China**, and has raised questions about the future of UK-China relations.

## Background & Context
The UK's relationship with **China** has been a topic of debate in recent years, particularly since the UK's decision to leave the EU. The UK is seeking to strengthen its trade relationships with countries around the world, including **China**, in order to offset the potential economic impact of **Brexit**. However, **China**'s human rights record and trade practices have been the subject of criticism from some countries, including the US.

**Trump** has been critical of **China**'s trade practices, and has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in an effort to address what he sees as unfair trade practices. **Trump**'s administration has also been critical of **China**'s human rights record, particularly in relation to the treatment of [Uyghur Muslims](/articles/china-says-top-military-official-under-investigation-for-serious-violations-of-discipline) in Xinjiang.

## Analysis
**Trump**'s warning to the UK about dealing with **China** is likely to be seen as an attempt to influence UK trade policy. The UK is seeking to strengthen its trade relationships with countries around the world, and **China** is a key market for UK goods and services. However, **Trump**'s warning highlights the risks of dealing with **China**, particularly in relation to trade practices and human rights.

For US citizens, **Trump**'s warning is a reminder of the complexities of international trade and diplomacy. The US has a significant trade relationship with **China**, and **Trump**'s administration has been critical of **China**'s trade practices. However, the US also has a significant strategic relationship with the UK, and **Trump**'s warning may be seen as an attempt to influence UK policy in a way that benefits the US.

## Quotes & Reactions
"[**China**] is a very dangerous country, and it's a very dangerous situation," **Trump** said in a recent statement. "I think it's a big mistake for the UK to be dealing with **China** in the way that they are."

**Keir Starmer**, the UK Labour leader, has responded to **Trump**'s warning by saying that the UK will make its own decisions about trade policy. "We will not be lectured to by **Donald Trump** on how to conduct our trade policy," **Starmer** said.

## Outlook
The future of UK-China relations is uncertain, and **Trump**'s warning has highlighted the risks and complexities of dealing with **China**. The UK will need to carefully consider its trade policy and strategic relationships in the coming months and years, and will need to balance its desire to strengthen trade ties with **China** with concerns about trade practices and human rights.

As the US and UK navigate their relationships with **China**, it is clear that the global trade landscape is becoming increasingly complex. **Trump**'s warning to the UK about dealing with **China** is a reminder of the need for careful consideration and strategic thinking in international trade and diplomacy.
