## Background & Context
Vietnam has undergone significant economic reforms in recent years, transforming itself from a centrally planned economy to a market-based economy. The country has achieved impressive economic growth, with its GDP growing at an average rate of 6% per year over the past decade. However, Vietnam still faces challenges such as corruption, inefficiency, and a lack of transparency.

He will need to implement reforms to drive economic growth and development, and tackle corruption and inefficiency."

**Dr. Le Dang Doanh**, a former advisor to the Vietnamese government, said: "To Lam's pledge of a 'new era of prosperity' is ambitious, but it's achievable if he can implement the necessary reforms. Vietnam has the potential to become a major economic player in the region, but it needs to tackle its challenges and improve its business environment."
