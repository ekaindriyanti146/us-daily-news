## Background & Context
The conflict between Israel and **Hamas** has been ongoing for decades, with periods of relative calm punctuated by outbreaks of violence. The most recent escalation began in 2021, when **Hamas** launched a series of rocket attacks against Israel, prompting a military response from the Israeli government. The conflict has resulted in significant loss of life and displacement of people on both sides. The issue of hostages has been a particularly contentious one, with **Hamas** holding several Israeli citizens captive for extended periods. The recovery of the last hostage's body is a significant development, but it remains to be seen whether it will lead to a lasting peace.

## Analysis
The statement by **Donald Trump** highlights the complex nature of the conflict between Israel and **Hamas**. While the recovery of the hostage's body is a positive development, it is unclear whether **Hamas** will follow through on its commitment to disarm.
