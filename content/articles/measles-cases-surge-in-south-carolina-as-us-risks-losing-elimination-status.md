This brings the total number of cases to 646, making it one of the largest measles outbreaks in the US in recent years.

## Background & Context

The outbreak has been linked to a lack of **vaccination** among certain communities, particularly in areas with low vaccination rates. **Health officials** have been working to contain the outbreak, but it has proven to be a challenging task. The outbreak has also raised concerns about the spread of other diseases, such as **mumps** and **rubella**, which can also be prevented through vaccination.

The US had previously eliminated measles in 2000, thanks to a comprehensive vaccination program. However, the current outbreak has raised concerns about the country's ability to maintain its elimination status. **The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** has been working closely with state and local health officials to contain the outbreak and prevent further spread of the disease.

## Analysis

The outbreak has also raised concerns about the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of diseases. **Vaccination** is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of measles and other diseases, and it is essential that individuals are vaccinated to protect themselves and their communities.

"The measles outbreak in South Carolina is a wake-up call for all of us," said **Dr. Anthony Fauci**, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. "We must take immediate action to contain the outbreak and prevent further spread of the disease."
