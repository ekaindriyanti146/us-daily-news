## Key Takeaways
* A NASA report has criticized the Boeing Starliner mission for unprofessional behavior
* The report designates the botched test flight as a 'Type A mishap'
* The mission left two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station
* NASA's decision-making process has been identified as flawed
* The report highlights the need for improved safety protocols and communication

## Introduction
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has released a scathing report on the Boeing Starliner mission, citing unprofessional behavior and designating the botched test flight as a 'Type A mishap'. The report comes after the mission left two astronauts stranded on the **International Space Station**. The incident has raised concerns about the safety and reliability of the Starliner spacecraft, which is intended to carry astronauts to and from the space station. According to NASA Administrator, the failure of the Starliner mission is one of the worst in the agency's history.

## Background & Context
The Starliner mission was launched in 2020, with the goal of testing the spacecraft's capabilities and preparing it for crewed missions. However, the mission was plagued by technical issues, including a software glitch that prevented the spacecraft from reaching the correct orbit. The incident has sparked a thorough investigation, with NASA and Boeing working together to identify the root causes of the failure. The report has highlighted a number of issues, including flawed decision-making, inadequate testing, and poor communication between NASA and Boeing. As reported by **BBC**, NASA's boss has stated that the Starliner failure is one of the worst in the agency's history.

### Investigation Findings
The investigation has found that NASA's decision-making process was flawed, with the agency failing to adequately address concerns about the spacecraft's software and testing procedures. The report also highlights the need for improved communication and collaboration between NASA and Boeing, as well as the importance of having a more robust safety culture. According to **CNN**, the report designates the botched Starliner test flight as a 'Type A mishap', which is the most severe classification for a mishap.

## Analysis
The report's findings are significant, as they highlight the need for improved safety protocols and communication in the development and testing of spacecraft. The incident has also raised concerns about the reliability of the Starliner spacecraft, which is intended to play a critical role in NASA's plans for future space missions. As reported by **The Jerusalem Post**, the report has identified unprofessional behavior as a major contributor to the mission's failure. The report's findings are likely to have implications for the development of future spacecraft, as well as the safety protocols and procedures used by NASA and its partners.

## Quotes & Reactions
"We take the findings of this report very seriously, and we are committed to implementing the recommended changes to ensure that our spacecraft are safe and reliable," said a NASA spokesperson. "The safety of our astronauts is our top priority, and we will do everything in our power to prevent such incidents from happening in the future." Boeing has also released a statement, saying that it is "committed to learning from this experience and applying those lessons to future missions." As reported by **Smithsonian Magazine**, the report reveals the failures that left two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station.

## Outlook
The report's findings are likely to have significant implications for the development of future spacecraft, as well as the safety protocols and procedures used by NASA and its partners. The incident has highlighted the need for improved communication and collaboration between NASA and its partners, as well as the importance of having a robust safety culture. As the space agency moves forward with its plans for future space missions, it will be important to prioritize safety and reliability, and to learn from the lessons of the Starliner mission. According to **SpaceNews**, the investigation has identified flawed NASA decision making as a major contributor to the mission's failure.
