## Background & Context
The Davos summit is an annual meeting of world leaders, economists, and business executives, where they gather to discuss the state of the global economy and the challenges facing the world. This year's summit was marked by a sense of uncertainty and tension, with many leaders expressing concerns about the rise of nationalism and protectionism. **Carney's** speech was seen as a call to action, urging leaders to work together to address the challenges facing the global economy. However, his comments on trade and the need for international cooperation were seen as a challenge to **Trump's** policies, which have been criticized for being protectionist and nationalist.

The US and Canada have been engaged in talks for some time, but progress has been slow. The two nations have a long-standing trade relationship, but recent tensions have made it difficult to reach an agreement. **Carney's** speech has added to the complexity of these talks, with some seeing it as a sign that Canada is looking to distance itself from the US. **Lutnick**, a Canadian businessman, has rejected Canada's China tilt, seeing summer USMCA talks as a way forward.
