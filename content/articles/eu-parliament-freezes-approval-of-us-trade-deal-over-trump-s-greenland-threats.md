## Background & Context
The US and the EU have been negotiating a trade deal for several years, with the goal of reducing tariffs and other trade barriers between the two economies. However, the talks have been stalled in recent months due to disagreements over issues such as agriculture and intellectual property. **Trump's** threats to impose tariffs on Greenland have added a new layer of complexity to the negotiations, and have sparked concerns among European lawmakers about the impact on the global economy.

The EU has been seeking to strengthen its trade relationships with other countries, including China and Japan, in response to **Trump's** aggressive trade policies. The suspension of the US trade deal is seen as a key component of this strategy, and is intended to send a signal to **Trump** that the EU will not be intimidated by his threats.
