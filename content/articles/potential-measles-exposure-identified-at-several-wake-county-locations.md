## Introduction
A measles outbreak has been identified in Wake County, North Carolina, with several locations potentially exposed to the virus. According to the Wake County Public Health department, a person with measles visited four locations in Raleigh while contagious, putting others at risk of infection. The department is warning the public to take precautions and get vaccinated if they have not already done so. In this article, we will provide an overview of the outbreak, its potential impact on the community, and what you can do to protect yourself and your loved ones.

## Background & Context
Measles is a highly contagious virus that can cause serious illness, especially in young children and people with weakened immune systems. The virus is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and can also be spread through contact with contaminated surfaces. Measles is characterized by a fever, rash, and symptoms such as cough, runny nose, and conjunctivitis. In rare cases, measles can lead to serious complications, such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and death. The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.html) recommends that all children receive two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, with the first dose given at 12-15 months of age and the second dose at 4-6 years of age.

The Wake County Public Health department is working to identify and contact individuals who may have been exposed to the virus, and is advising the public to take precautions to prevent the spread of the disease. This includes getting vaccinated, washing hands frequently, and avoiding close contact with anyone who has been infected.

## Analysis
The measles outbreak in Wake County is a reminder of the importance of vaccination and public health measures in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Measles is a highly contagious virus that can spread quickly in communities with low vaccination rates. The outbreak is also a reminder of the importance of global health security, as measles is a global health threat that can be introduced into a community through international travel.

The economic impact of a measles outbreak can be significant, with costs associated with healthcare, lost productivity, and public health measures.
