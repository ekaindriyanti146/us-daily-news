## Introduction
A recent outbreak of measles in California has been linked to an international traveler who visited **Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)** and **Disneyland**. The outbreak has resulted in multiple confirmed cases of measles in Southern California, with health officials warning of a risk of exposure at the airport and theme park. According to reports, one infected person spent several hours at **Disneyland**, potentially exposing others to the virus. The **Orange County Health Care Agency** has confirmed two cases of measles in travelers who visited **Disneyland** and **California Adventure**.

## Background & Context
Measles is a highly contagious viral illness that can cause fever, cough, runny nose, and a characteristic rash. It can be prevented with vaccination, and the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** recommends that children receive two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, with the first dose given at 12-15 months of age and the second dose given at 4-6 years of age. Adults who have not been vaccinated or have not had measles may also be at risk of infection. The **World Health Organization (WHO)** estimates that measles vaccination has prevented over 20 million deaths worldwide since 2000.

The current outbreak in California is a reminder of the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of infectious diseases. **Dr. Jennifer Ashton**, a physician and health expert, notes that "measles is a highly contagious disease that can have serious complications, especially in young children and individuals with weakened immune systems. Vaccination is the best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases."

## Analysis
The measles outbreak in California highlights the need for continued vigilance in maintaining high vaccination rates, particularly in areas with high volumes of international travel. **Dr. Peter Hotez**, a professor of pediatrics and molecular virology at **Baylor College of Medicine**, notes that "measles is a disease that can be easily prevented with vaccination, but it requires a high level of community immunity to prevent outbreaks. We need to ensure that all individuals, especially those traveling internationally, are up-to-date on their vaccinations to prevent the spread of measles and other infectious diseases."

The outbreak also underscores the importance of timely and effective public health responses to infectious disease outbreaks. **Dr. Robert Redfield**, the former director of the **CDC**, notes that "rapid identification and response to infectious disease outbreaks are critical in preventing the spread of disease and protecting public health. We need to continue to invest in our public health infrastructure and support the work of local and state health departments in responding to outbreaks like this one."
