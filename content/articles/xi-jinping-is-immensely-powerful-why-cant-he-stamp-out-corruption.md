## Background & Context
China has a long history of corruption, with many high-ranking officials being accused of abusing their power for personal gain. The problem is particularly acute in the country's vast and complex bureaucracy, where officials often have significant discretion to make decisions and allocate resources. **Xi Jinping** has made addressing corruption a key priority, with a range of initiatives aimed at increasing transparency and accountability within the government. However, despite these efforts, corruption remains a significant problem in China, with many officials continuing to engage in corrupt practices with impunity.

### The Scale of the Problem
