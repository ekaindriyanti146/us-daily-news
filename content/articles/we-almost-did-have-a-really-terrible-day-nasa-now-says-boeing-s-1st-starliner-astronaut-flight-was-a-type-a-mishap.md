## Key Takeaways
* NASA designates Boeing's 1st Starliner astronaut flight as a 'Type A mishap'
* The incident occurred during the spacecraft's initial crewed flight test
* An investigation revealed a series of errors and oversights led to the mishap
* NASA and Boeing are working to address the issues and improve the spacecraft's safety
* The incident has significant implications for the future of commercial space travel

## Introduction
On a day that could have ended in disaster, NASA's **Starliner** spacecraft narrowly avoided a catastrophic failure during its first crewed flight test. According to a recent report, the incident has been classified as a 'Type A mishap', one of the most severe categories of mishaps in the space agency's classification system. The **Boeing**-built spacecraft was carrying two astronauts on its maiden crewed voyage when the incident occurred. Fortunately, the astronauts were able to return safely to Earth, but the incident has raised serious concerns about the safety and reliability of the **Starliner** spacecraft.

## Background & Context
The **Starliner** spacecraft is part of NASA's **Commercial Crew Program**, which aims to develop private spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts to and from the **International Space Station**. The program is a crucial step towards establishing a sustainable presence in space, and the **Starliner** is one of two spacecraft, along with **SpaceX**'s **Crew Dragon**, that have been selected for the program. The recent incident has highlighted the challenges and risks associated with space travel and the need for rigorous testing and safety protocols.

The investigation into the incident revealed a series of errors and oversights, including a software glitch that caused the spacecraft's thrusters to malfunction. The glitch led to a loss of control, and the spacecraft was unable to rendezvous with the **International Space Station** as planned. The astronauts on board were forced to abort the mission and return to Earth, but not before experiencing a harrowing ordeal.

### Investigation Findings
The investigation into the incident has identified several key factors that contributed to the mishap. These include:
* A software glitch that caused the spacecraft's thrusters to malfunction
* Inadequate testing and validation of the spacecraft's systems
* Insufficient communication and coordination between **NASA** and **Boeing** teams
* A lack of redundancy and backup systems to prevent a single point of failure

## Analysis
The incident has significant implications for the future of commercial space travel. The **Starliner** spacecraft is designed to carry astronauts to and from the **International Space Station**, and any failure or mishap could have disastrous consequences. The incident has also raised concerns about the safety and reliability of the **Starliner** spacecraft and the **Commercial Crew Program** as a whole.

The incident is a reminder that space travel is a complex and inherently risky endeavor. The **Starliner** spacecraft is a highly sophisticated machine, and even small errors or oversights can have significant consequences. The incident has highlighted the need for rigorous testing and safety protocols, as well as robust communication and coordination between teams.

### Implications for US Citizens
The incident has significant implications for US citizens, who rely on **NASA** and the **Commercial Crew Program** to advance the nation's interests in space. The incident has raised concerns about the safety and reliability of the **Starliner** spacecraft and the **Commercial Crew Program**, and has highlighted the need for increased transparency and accountability.

## Quotes & Reactions
"We almost did have a really terrible day," said **NASA Administrator**, [**Jim Bridenstine**](/articles/nasa-administrator-jim-bridenstine-resigns-after-biden-takes-office). "The incident was a wake-up call for us, and we're taking it very seriously."

"The incident was a reminder that space travel is a complex and inherently risky endeavor," said [**Boeing**](/articles/boeing-737-max-returns-to-skies-after-nearly-2-year-grounding) spokesperson. "We're working closely with **NASA** to address the issues and improve the safety and reliability of the **Starliner** spacecraft."

## Outlook
The incident has significant implications for the future of commercial space travel. **NASA** and **Boeing** are working to address the issues and improve the safety and reliability of the **Starliner** spacecraft. The incident has highlighted the need for rigorous testing and safety protocols, as well as robust communication and coordination between teams.

The **Starliner** spacecraft is expected to play a critical role in the **Commercial Crew Program**, and the incident has raised concerns about the program's timeline and budget. **NASA** and **Boeing** are working to get the program back on track, but the incident has highlighted the challenges and risks associated with space travel.

As the space agency and its partners work to overcome the challenges and risks associated with space travel, one thing is clear: the incident has highlighted the need for increased transparency and accountability in the **Commercial Crew Program**. US citizens can expect a thorough investigation and a renewed commitment to safety and reliability in the program.
