## Introduction
North Korea has announced that it will hold a party congress in February, the first since 2021. The event is expected to be a significant one, with the ruling **Workers' Party of Korea** set to discuss key issues such as the country's economy and foreign policy.

As the international community watches the event closely, we take a closer look at what to expect from the party congress and what it may mean for North Korea's future.

## Background & Context
The **Workers' Party of Korea** has been the ruling party in North Korea since its founding in 1946. The party has a long history of holding congresses, which are typically held every few years to discuss key issues and announce new policies. The last party congress was held in 2021, and it saw the promotion of **Kim Jong-un** to the position of general secretary of the party. The congress also announced a new five-year plan for the country's economy, which included goals such as increasing the production of coal and steel.

The upcoming party congress is expected to build on the policies announced at the last congress, and to discuss new issues such as the country's relations with the US and other nations. The congress may also see the promotion of new leaders, which could have implications for the country's future. As the international community watches the event closely, there are many questions about what the party congress may mean for North Korea's future and its relations with the rest of the world.

### Recent Developments
In recent years, North Korea has been in the news for its provocative actions, including the testing of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. The country has also been subject to international sanctions, which have had a significant impact on its economy. Despite these challenges, North Korea has continued to develop its military capabilities, and has announced plans to increase its production of coal and steel.

The party congress may also discuss the country's relations with the US, which have been strained in recent years. The two countries have been engaged in a series of diplomatic talks, but these have been stalled in recent months. The congress may see the announcement of new policies towards the US, which could have implications for the two countries' relations.
