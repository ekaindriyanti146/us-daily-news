## Introduction
The **Artemis II** mission is a historic event that marks the first time humans will return to the Moon since the **Apollo** era. The mission is a crucial step towards establishing a sustainable human presence on the lunar surface and eventually sending humans to Mars. However, before the crew can embark on their journey, they must undergo a rigorous quarantine period to ensure that they are healthy and free from any potential illnesses that could jeopardize the mission. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind the quarantine, the preparations that the crew must undergo, and the significance of the **Artemis II** mission.

## Background & Context
The **Artemis II** mission is part of **NASA**'s ambitious plan to return humans to the Moon by 2025 and establish a sustainable presence on the lunar surface. The mission will test the **Orion** spacecraft and the **Space Launch System (SLS)** rocket, which will be used for future deep space missions. The crew will consist of four astronauts who will spend approximately 26 days in space, including 10 days in lunar orbit. The mission will also include a series of spacewalks and a lunar landing, which will be the first time humans have set foot on the Moon since the **Apollo 17** mission in 1972.

The quarantine period is a critical step in ensuring the success of the mission. The crew will be isolated from the general public and will undergo a series of medical checks and tests to ensure that they are healthy and free from any potential illnesses.
