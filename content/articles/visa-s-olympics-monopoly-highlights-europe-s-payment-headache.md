## Background & Context
The European payments market is dominated by **Visa** and **Mastercard**, with these two companies controlling a significant share of the market.

The lack of competition and innovation in the payments market can lead to higher fees and less convenient payment options for consumers. Additionally, the reliance on US-based companies can make it difficult for European businesses to compete in the global market.

The development of alternative payment systems is essential for promoting competition and innovation in the payments market. This can be achieved through initiatives such as the **EPI**, which aims to create a pan-European payment system that is independent of **Visa** and **Mastercard**. Additionally, the **European Union** can promote competition and innovation through regulatory measures, such as the **PSD2**.
