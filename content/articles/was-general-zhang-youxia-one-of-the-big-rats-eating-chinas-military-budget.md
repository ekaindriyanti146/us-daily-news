## Background & Context
The purge of China's military leadership is not a new phenomenon.

The investigation into General Zhang Youxia is seen as a move by President Xi Jinping to further consolidate his power and eliminate potential threats to his rule.

The purge has also raised questions about the role of the military in Chinese society. The Chinese military, also known as the People's Liberation Army (PLA), is a powerful institution that plays a significant role in the country's politics and economy. The purge has led to speculation about the potential for instability within the military and the potential for a power struggle between different factions.
