## Introduction
The United States has imposed sanctions on 9 vessels in Iran's "shadow fleet" for their role in transporting oil and supporting the government's crackdown on protests. The move is part of a broader effort by the US to pressure Iran over its human rights record and support for violent protests. The sanctions were announced by the US Treasury Department, which said that the vessels were being used to transport oil and other goods in support of the Iranian government's efforts to suppress dissent.

The US has been critical of Iran's human rights record, particularly in recent months, as the government has cracked down on protests against its rule. The protests, which began in response to the death of a young woman in police custody, have grown into a broader movement calling for reforms and greater freedoms. The Iranian government has responded with force, using security forces to break up protests and arrest demonstrators.

## Background & Context
The US has a long history of tensions with Iran, dating back to the 1979 revolution that overthrew the US-backed government of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. Since then, the two countries have been at odds over a range of issues, including nuclear proliferation, regional security, and human rights. The US has imposed numerous sanctions on Iran over the years, including sanctions on its oil industry, which is a major source of revenue for the government.

In recent months, the US has stepped up its criticism of Iran's human rights record, particularly in response to the government's crackdown on protests. The US has imposed sanctions on several Iranian officials accused of repressing protests, and has called on the international community to join it in condemning Iran's actions.

The "shadow fleet" of vessels sanctioned by the US is believed to be used by Iran to transport oil and other goods in secret, avoiding international sanctions. The vessels are often registered in other countries and fly false flags, making it difficult to track their movements and activities. The US has been working to disrupt Iran's use of the "shadow fleet", and the sanctions announced today are part of that effort.
