## Introduction
In a groundbreaking discovery, scientists have found two enormous hot blobs of rock deep within the Earth, which are shaping the planet's magnetic field. The Earth's magnetic field is a complex and dynamic system that protects the planet from harmful solar and cosmic radiation. However, it has been observed that the magnetic field has been changing over millions of years, with some areas strengthening and others weakening. The discovery of the hot blobs provides a new explanation for these changes and sheds light on the Earth's internal structure. **Who** are the scientists behind this discovery? A team of researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder, led by Dr. Peter Olson. **What** did they discover? Two massive hot blobs of rock, located in the Earth's mantle. **When** was the discovery made? Recently, using advanced imaging techniques. **Where** are the hot blobs located? On either side of the Earth's core. **Why** is this discovery important? It provides new insights into the Earth's internal structure and the magnetic field.

## Background & Context
The Earth's magnetic field is generated by the movement of molten iron in the Earth's core. However, the magnetic field is not uniform and has been observed to change over time. One of the most significant changes is the **[weakening of the magnetic field](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxOczhJTDZmMndwM21aMlVuSVZkRXZwS2lGdUlOZGZhUWxkTEZWQTM0QTRRNDcxSTR1NEIyQTFQS09ERi1fX1BYZFZwXzRlUVh6U2NNMFFaQW9kMWE1OWp6UnNzOC1sOVloMUs2UG9VY05LY2hfUVNSODdGeFpzazcwZDFtTjdwX29fWlh4YUdaMzVyNXNhSFFUOTlUSllXM0pQODNHVXRfV1RvYWRQeTZSZA?oc=5)** in the Western Hemisphere.
