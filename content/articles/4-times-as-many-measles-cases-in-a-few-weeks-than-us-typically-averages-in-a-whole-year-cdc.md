## Introduction
The **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)** has reported a significant surge in measles cases in the US, with 4 times as many cases in a few weeks than the country typically averages in a whole year. This outbreak has raised concerns about the effectiveness of current vaccination strategies and the need for increased awareness about the risks of measles. As of now, the outbreak has reached 920 cases in **South Carolina**, with **brain swelling** being one of the nastiest side effects. The **World Health Organization (WHO)** has also warned about the risks of measles, emphasizing the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of the disease.

## Background & Context
Measles is a highly contagious viral disease that can cause serious health complications, including **brain swelling**, **pneumonia**, and **death**. The disease is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and it can also be spread through contact with contaminated surfaces. The **CDC** recommends that all children receive two doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, with the first dose given at 12-15 months of age and the second dose given at 4-6 years of age. However, some parents have opted out of vaccinating their children, citing concerns about the safety of vaccines. This has led to a decline in vaccination rates in some areas, making it easier for diseases like measles to spread.

## Analysis
The current measles outbreak in the US is a significant concern, as it highlights the risks of not vaccinating children. The **CDC** has emphasized the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of measles, and health experts have warned that the current outbreak could have been prevented if more children had been vaccinated. The outbreak has also raised concerns about the effectiveness of current vaccination strategies, with some experts calling for increased awareness about the risks of measles and the importance of vaccination. As **Dr. Anthony Fauci**, Director of the **National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases**, has said, "Vaccination is the best way to prevent the spread of measles, and it is essential that all children receive the recommended doses of the MMR vaccine."

## Quotes & Reactions
"We are seeing a significant surge in measles cases, and it is essential that we take immediate action to prevent the spread of the disease," said **Dr. Robert Redfield**, Director of the **CDC**. "Vaccination is the best way to prevent measles, and we urge all parents to ensure that their children receive the recommended doses of the MMR vaccine." **Dr. Peter Hotez**, a vaccine expert at **Baylor College of Medicine**, has also emphasized the importance of vaccination, saying, "The current measles outbreak is a wake-up call for all of us, and it highlights the need for increased awareness about the risks of measles and the importance of vaccination."

## Outlook
The current measles outbreak in the US is a significant concern, and it highlights the need for increased awareness about the risks of measles and the importance of vaccination. As the **CDC** continues to monitor the situation, health experts are urging all parents to ensure that their children receive the recommended doses of the MMR vaccine. The **WHO** has also warned about the risks of measles, emphasizing the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of the disease. As we move forward, it is essential that we take immediate action to prevent the spread of measles and protect public health.
