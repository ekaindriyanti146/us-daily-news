## Background & Context
The **Dilley immigrant family detention center** is a facility operated by **US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)**, which houses immigrant families, including children, who are awaiting processing and potential deportation. The facility has been the subject of controversy and criticism in the past, with concerns raised about the conditions, healthcare, and treatment of detainees.

## Analysis
The measles outbreak at the **Dilley immigrant family detention center** is a significant public health concern, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children and individuals with weakened immune systems.

The incident highlights the need for improved healthcare and sanitation at detention centers, as well as the importance of vaccination and disease prevention measures. Furthermore, the outbreak raises questions about the **[government shutdown](/articles/trump-signs-spending-bill-that-ends-four-day-government-shutdown)** and its impact on public health services.

## Quotes & Reactions
"I am deeply concerned about the measles outbreak at the **Dilley immigrant family detention center**," said **Dr. Peter Hotez**, a leading expert on infectious diseases. "The conditions at the facility are ripe for the spread of infectious diseases, and it is unacceptable that we are not doing more to protect the health and well-being of these vulnerable populations." Dr. Hotez emphasized the importance of vaccination and disease prevention measures, citing the success of the [childhood vaccine schedule](/articles/doctors-offer-rival-childhood-vaccine-schedule-to-trump-administration-s). **Rep.

## Outlook

The incident highlights the importance of vaccination and disease prevention measures, as well as the need for greater transparency and accountability in the management of detention facilities.
