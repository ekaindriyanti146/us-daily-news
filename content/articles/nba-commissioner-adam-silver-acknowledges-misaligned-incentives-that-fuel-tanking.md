## Introduction
The **National Basketball Association (NBA)** has been struggling with the issue of tanking for years. Tanking, or the practice of intentionally losing games to secure better draft picks, has been a problem for the league, as it can lead to a lack of competitiveness and excitement in the regular season. Recently, **NBA Commissioner Adam Silver** acknowledged the issue, stating that there are "misaligned incentives" that fuel tanking. In this article, we will explore the issue of tanking in the NBA, and what the league is doing to address it.

## Background & Context
Tanking has been a problem in the NBA for years, with teams like the **Philadelphia 76ers** and **Chicago Bulls** being accused of intentionally losing games to secure better draft picks. The issue is complex, with many factors contributing to it. One of the main reasons teams tank is to secure high draft picks, which can be used to select top talent and build a competitive team. However, this can lead to a lack of competitiveness in the regular season, as teams are more focused on losing games than winning them.

The NBA has tried to address the issue of tanking in the past, with changes to the draft lottery system and the introduction of the **NBA G League**. However, the problem persists, and the league is looking for new ways to prevent tanking and promote competitive balance. One possible solution is to change the draft structure, which could include taking away draft picks from teams that are found to be tanking.

## Analysis
The issue of tanking is important for **US citizens** because it affects the competitiveness and excitement of the NBA. When teams are tanking, it can lead to a lack of interest in the regular season, as fans are not invested in the outcome of games. This can also have a negative impact on the league's revenue, as fans are less likely to attend games or watch them on television.

Furthermore, tanking can also have a negative impact on the development of young players. When teams are tanking, they may be less likely to play their young players, as they are focused on losing games rather than developing their talent. This can lead to a lack of experience and playing time for young players, which can hinder their development and potentially harm their careers.

## Quotes & Reactions
"We're looking at all remedies for tanking, including changing the draft structure," said **NBA Commissioner Adam Silver**. "We want to make sure that teams are incentivized to compete and win games, rather than lose them."

"I think it's a problem that needs to be addressed," said **Los Angeles Lakers** coach **Frank Vogel**. "Tanking can lead to a lack of competitiveness and excitement in the regular season, and it's not good for the league."

## Outlook
The NBA is committed to addressing the issue of tanking and promoting competitive balance. The league is considering all remedies, including changing the draft structure and taking away draft picks from teams that are found to be tanking. While the issue is complex, the NBA is determined to find a solution that will promote competitiveness and excitement in the regular season.

In the meantime, fans can expect to see some changes in the way teams approach the regular season. With the league's focus on competitive balance, teams may be more likely to play their young players and focus on winning games, rather than losing them. This could lead to a more exciting and competitive regular season, with more teams in contention for the playoffs.

As the NBA continues to evolve and grow, the issue of tanking will remain a top priority. With the league's commitment to competitive balance and the introduction of new remedies, fans can expect to see a more exciting and competitive league in the years to come.
