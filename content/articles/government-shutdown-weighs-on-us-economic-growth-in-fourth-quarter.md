## Introduction
The US economy has experienced a slowdown in growth in the fourth quarter of 2025, with the GDP growing at a rate of 1.4%. This is lower than the expected growth rate, and it has raised concerns about the overall health of the economy. The government shutdown, which lasted for several weeks, had a significant impact on the economy, contributing to the slower growth. In this article, we will examine the reasons behind the slower growth, the impact of the government shutdown, and what this means for the future of the US economy.

## Background & Context
The US economy has been experiencing a period of growth, with the GDP growing at a steady rate over the past few years. However, the government shutdown, which started in December 2025, had a significant impact on the economy. The shutdown resulted in a loss of productivity, as many government employees were furloughed, and it also disrupted the flow of goods and services. This had a ripple effect on the economy, with many businesses experiencing a decline in sales and revenue.

The [government shutdown](/articles/government-shutdown-ends-after-35-days) also had an impact on the housing market, with many potential homebuyers unable to secure mortgages due to the lack of government-backed loans. This resulted in a decline in housing sales, which had a further impact on the economy.

## Analysis
The slower growth rate of the US economy in the fourth quarter of 2025 has raised concerns about the overall health of the economy. The government shutdown, which lasted for several weeks, had a significant impact on the economy, contributing to the slower growth. The shutdown resulted in a loss of productivity, disrupted the flow of goods and services, and had a ripple effect on the economy.

The [inflation rate](/articles/inflation-rate-remains-steady-at-3) remained steady at 3%, with the Federal Reserve keeping a close eye on the situation. The Fed has been monitoring the inflation rate closely, as it has been steadily increasing over the past few years. The Fed has been using monetary policy to keep the inflation rate in check, but it remains to be seen whether these efforts will be successful.

The slower growth rate has also raised concerns about the potential for a recession in the near future. A recession is defined as a period of economic decline, typically lasting for several months or even years. The US economy has experienced several recessions in the past, including the [Great Recession](/articles/great-recession-10-years-later) of 2008.
