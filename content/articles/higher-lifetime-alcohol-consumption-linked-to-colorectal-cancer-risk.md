## Introduction
A recent study published in a reputable medical journal has shed light on the relationship between lifetime alcohol consumption and the risk of colorectal cancer. The research, which analyzed data from a large cohort of participants, found that higher levels of alcohol consumption are associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. This discovery has significant implications for individuals, healthcare providers, and policymakers, as it highlights the importance of moderate alcohol consumption and regular health check-ups. According to [Medical Xpress](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQRDdnUmZUT1hzaDhqZGZKbFlqQ2ZrVDJ1RU96RXI5aVdyQnNDSHRsSmRUNE56cnlUN3R6UmdLTElpejBnVjJ3Rk5MNVBDMElVTDFGV0R6aFBDZXplQmNTdG1KQUc3cUp4a2RnYnZadWliRjlzSXBnQ0NhdWZMQzdlbXlrQXEzVVBVenFFSUFCVQ?oc=5), the study found that drinking more than two glasses of wine per day can raise the risk of bowel cancer by 25%.

## Background & Context
Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the colon or rectum, and is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. According to the [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/), colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the United States, with over 140,000 new cases diagnosed each year. The disease is often asymptomatic in its early stages, making regular health check-ups and screenings crucial for early detection and treatment. The study's findings are consistent with previous research, which has suggested a link between alcohol consumption and an increased risk of certain types of cancer, including [colorectal cancer](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/colon-rectal-cancer.html). As reported by [ABC News](https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNMzdpOFc0eV9Ja0tPYkZZVXRsVVRhajlIYWhTQUNqRDktNDAxaG5QNk9GeXNtQW5kTmhmeUwzOW1VOF84Tzg5bm95VER6MC1KNWhGN2ROaElWQUpTVGZrVUt6a1JFX0JFOEVOdk1vVk9MXzRvNVU4cWFnRlR1dFk3dnRrblJrYUd0UE1YeTZGa2pXUkczdFkzU1pHZnFGMDQ3SFA3N0pjLUJNZ9IBrwFBVV95cUxNd3VDMG52b2lLTkJBWDZtbVFna1BUVWVLanZnU1hhZzUxMWIxTGZoVUluMHFUYUxXWXJSMVRhX3NRWEdzTXVoLWM0NmVqSU5tSGlac1c0NENhUVdfNHZHYUdmelVHbnRMWVJSVXVqUjV3S2NnWDFHLWlfQzBGd3R1clM3bFdCVnlpa1JqTFk0Z2RZbW43WFVDYlo5Y2NjNFlhZzdFelQ3QXZ2UEZGR2VJ?oc=5), the study's results have significant implications for public health.
