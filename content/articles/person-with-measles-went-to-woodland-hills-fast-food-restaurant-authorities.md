## Introduction
A measles outbreak has hit Los Angeles County, with two cases confirmed by the Public Health Department. The first case was reported in a person who visited a fast food restaurant in Woodland Hills, potentially exposing others to the virus. This outbreak has raised concerns among health officials, who are warning of possible measles exposure at several locations, including LAX, Woodland Hills, and Disneyland. In this article, we will provide an overview of the outbreak, its causes, and what you can do to protect yourself and your loved ones.

## Background & Context
Measles is a highly contagious virus that can cause serious health complications, especially in young children and people with weakened immune systems. The virus is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and can also be spread through contact with contaminated surfaces. The symptoms of measles include fever, cough, runny nose, and a characteristic rash that appears on the face and spreads to the rest of the body. In severe cases, measles can lead to complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, and even death.

The measles vaccine is highly effective in preventing the spread of the virus, but there are still many people who are not vaccinated, either due to personal beliefs or lack of access to healthcare. This has led to a resurgence of measles cases in recent years, with outbreaks reported in several countries around the world. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all children receive two doses of the measles vaccine, one at 12-15 months of age and a second dose at 4-6 years of age.

## Analysis
The current measles outbreak in Los Angeles County is a concern for public health officials, as it has the potential to spread quickly and affect many people. The fact that a person with measles visited a fast food restaurant in Woodland Hills, potentially exposing others to the virus, highlights the need for vigilance and prompt action to prevent further spread. Health officials are working to identify anyone who may have been exposed to the virus and are providing guidance on how to prevent the spread of measles.

According to [Dr. Robert Redfield](https://www.cdc.gov/about/leadership/leaders/robert-r-redfield.htm), former Director of the CDC, "Measles is a highly contagious virus that can have serious health consequences, especially for young children and people with weakened immune systems. It is essential that we take all necessary steps to prevent the spread of measles, including ensuring that all children are vaccinated and taking precautions to prevent exposure to the virus."
