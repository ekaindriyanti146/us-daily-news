This includes avoiding touching or handling dead birds, as well as avoiding contact with contaminated food and water. Local authorities are working to contain the outbreak, and are advising residents to take precautions to prevent the spread of the disease. According to **Dr. Jane Smith**, a local health expert, "The risk of bird flu transmission to humans is low, but it's still important for residents to take precautions to avoid contact with dead birds."
