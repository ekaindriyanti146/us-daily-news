## Background & Context
Greenland, with its vast ice sheets and natural resources, has long been a topic of interest for the US.

However, the details of the deal remain unclear, and it is still unknown what specific provisions are included.

The deal has been met with skepticism from some, who question its feasibility and potential consequences. **Denmark**, which has sovereignty over Greenland, has expressed concerns about the deal, citing the need for **transparency** and **consultation**. **NATO**, which has a significant presence in the region, has also asked its allies to step up their contributions, potentially in response to the US's shifting priorities.
