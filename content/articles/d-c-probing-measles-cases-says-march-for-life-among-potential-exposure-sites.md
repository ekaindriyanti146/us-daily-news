## Background & Context
Measles is a highly contagious virus that can cause serious illness, particularly in young children and individuals with weakened immune systems. The virus is spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and can also be spread through contact with contaminated surfaces. According to the **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)**, measles is one of the most contagious viruses known, with a single infected person able to spread the virus to up to 18 other people. The **CDC** also reports that measles cases have been increasing in recent years, with a total of 1,282 cases reported in the United States in 2022.

The **March for Life** rally, which is held annually in Washington D.C., is a large gathering of individuals who come to advocate for the rights of the unborn. The rally typically draws thousands of attendees from across the country, and is a significant event in the city's calendar. This year's rally was no exception, with thousands of attendees gathering in the city to participate in the event.

## Analysis
The measles outbreak in D.C. is a significant public health concern, particularly given the highly contagious nature of the virus. The fact that the **March for Life** rally is among the potential exposure sites is particularly concerning, given the large number of attendees at the event. Health officials are warning individuals who attended the rally to be aware of the symptoms of measles, which can include fever, cough, runny nose, and a rash. Individuals who are experiencing these symptoms are advised to seek medical attention immediately.

The outbreak is also a reminder of the importance of vaccination and public health measures. The **CDC** recommends that all individuals be vaccinated against measles, with two doses of the vaccine typically required for full protection. However, some individuals may not be vaccinated due to medical or philosophical exemptions. Health officials are urging all individuals to ensure that they are up to date on their vaccinations, particularly in light of the current outbreak.
