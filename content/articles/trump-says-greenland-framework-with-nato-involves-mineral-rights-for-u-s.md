In a surprise move, **Trump** revealed a framework deal with **NATO** that involves **Greenland** and U.S. mineral rights.

"I think **Trump** is trying to distract from his failed policies at home by making a big splash on the international stage," said **Dr.** [Name], a foreign policy expert at [University]. "But this deal has the potential to backfire and create more problems for the U.S. in the long run."

## Outlook
