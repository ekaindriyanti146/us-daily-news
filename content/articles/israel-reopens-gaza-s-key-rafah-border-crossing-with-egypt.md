The Rafah border crossing has been a critical entry and exit point for the Gaza Strip since the 1990s. The crossing was originally controlled by Israel, but was transferred to the Palestinian Authority in 1995 as part of the Oslo Accords. However, in 2007, Israel and Egypt closed the crossing after Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip. Since then, the crossing has been closed for most of the time, with only occasional openings for humanitarian cases.
