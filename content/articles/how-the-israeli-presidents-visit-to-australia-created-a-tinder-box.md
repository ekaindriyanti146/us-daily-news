## Background & Context
The Israeli President's visit to Australia was seen as a significant event in the diplomatic calendar, with the aim of strengthening economic and strategic ties between the two nations.

### Historical Context

The conflict has been fueled by competing claims to the same land, with the Israeli government asserting its right to a Jewish homeland, and the Palestinian people seeking self-determination and statehood. The conflict has resulted in numerous wars, massacres, and human rights abuses, with both sides suffering significant losses. The Israeli government's actions in the occupied territories, including the construction of settlements and the demolition of Palestinian homes, have been widely condemned by the international community.
