## Background & Context
The **iPhone 18 Pro** is expected to be a major upgrade over the current **iPhone 17 Pro**, with a number of new features and improvements. One of the most significant changes is the smaller **Dynamic Island**, which is expected to be a key feature of the new device. The **Dynamic Island** is a feature that allows users to interact with the phone's camera and other sensors in a more intuitive way.

In addition to the smaller **Dynamic Island**, the **iPhone 18 Pro** is also expected to have a redesigned **selfie camera**. Leaks have suggested that the new camera will have a number of improvements, including a higher resolution sensor and improved low-light performance. However, some leaks have cast doubt on the **selfie camera redesign**, suggesting that it may not be as significant as initially thought.

**Apple** is also rumored to be working on **foldable iPhones**, which are expected to be a major innovation in the smartphone industry. The **foldable iPhones** are expected to be priced at around $2,000, and will feature a flexible display that can be folded and unfolded like a book. This will allow users to have a larger screen when they need it, and a smaller, more compact device when they don't.
