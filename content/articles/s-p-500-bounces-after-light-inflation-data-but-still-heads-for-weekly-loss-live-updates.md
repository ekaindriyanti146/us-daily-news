## Introduction
The **S&P 500** saw a significant uptick on Friday after the release of the latest inflation data, which showed a cooling in January. This news sparked a rally in the stock market, with the **Dow** and **Nasdaq** also experiencing gains. However, despite this positive movement, the S&P 500 is still headed for a weekly loss. The inflation data, which was released on Friday morning, showed that prices rose less than expected in January, offering some relief for consumers. This news was seen as a positive sign for the economy, and investors responded by buying stocks.

The **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**, which measures the average change in prices of a basket of goods and services, rose by 0.5% in January, which was lower than the expected 0.6% increase. This decrease in inflation has sparked hopes that the **Federal Reserve** may slow down its pace of interest rate hikes, which could help to boost the economy. The stock market has been volatile in recent weeks, with investors reacting to news on inflation, interest rates, and the overall state of the economy.

## Background & Context
The release of the inflation data is a significant event in the economic calendar, as it provides insight into the state of the economy and the potential actions of the **Federal Reserve**. The **Federal Reserve** has been closely watching inflation data, as it seeks to balance the need to control inflation with the need to support economic growth. The latest inflation data suggests that the economy may be slowing down, which could lead to a decrease in interest rates.
