In a surprising turn of events, the sci-fi film **Mercy** has taken down **Avatar: Fire and Ash** from its five-weekend reign at the box office, debuting at $11 million. The movie, starring **Chris Pratt**, has received mixed reviews from critics, but its performance is notable given the current state of the box office. A monster winter storm has taken its toll on the industry, with over 400 U.S. theaters shut down, resulting in the lowest weekend of the year, with a total of $58 million.

## Background & Context
The box office has been experiencing a slump in recent weeks, with many films struggling to perform well. **Avatar: Fire and Ash** had been dominating the charts, but its reign has finally come to an end. **Mercy**, directed by an up-and-coming filmmaker, has been generating buzz due to its unique premise and **Chris Pratt**'s involvement. The film's debut is a significant achievement, considering the challenges faced by the industry.

The winter storm has had a devastating impact on the box office, with many theaters forced to close due to the harsh weather conditions. This has resulted in a significant decline in ticket sales, with the total box office revenue for the weekend being the lowest of the year. Despite this, **Mercy** has managed to perform relatively well, with a near $23 million worldwide debut.

## Analysis

The film's performance is also a testament to the resilience of the box office, which has been facing numerous challenges in recent weeks. The monster winter storm has had a significant impact on the industry, but **Mercy**'s debut suggests that there is still a demand for new and exciting films.

The box office slump can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the rise of streaming services and the increasing competition for audience attention. However, **Mercy**'s performance suggests that there is still a place for traditional filmmaking, and that audiences are willing to venture out to the theaters to experience new and exciting stories.
