## Introduction
The United States is preparing to host the Critical Minerals Ministerial, a pivotal gathering of international leaders aimed at tackling the pressing issue of global supply chain challenges for critical minerals. These minerals, which include **lithium**, **cobalt**, and **rare earth elements**, are crucial for the production of advanced technologies such as **electric vehicles**, **renewable energy systems**, and **semiconductors**. The meeting, scheduled to take place in the coming weeks, will bring together ministers and senior officials from over 20 countries, including major producers and consumers of critical minerals. The event is expected to be a significant step forward in promoting international cooperation and coordination on this critical issue, which has far-reaching implications for the global economy, national security, and the environment.

## Background & Context
The global demand for critical minerals has been increasing rapidly in recent years, driven by the growing need for advanced technologies that rely on these resources. However, the supply chain for these minerals is often fragile and vulnerable to disruptions, which can have significant consequences for industries that rely on them. The **US Department of State** has recognized the importance of addressing this issue and has taken the lead in organizing the Critical Minerals Ministerial. The meeting will provide a platform for countries to share their experiences, discuss best practices, and explore ways to promote sustainable and responsible mining practices. It will also focus on supporting the development of new technologies and industries related to critical minerals, such as **recycling** and **substitution**.

### Global Dependence on Critical Minerals
The world's dependence on critical minerals is a complex issue, with many countries relying on imports to meet their needs. The **US**, for example, is heavily reliant on imports of critical minerals, with over 50% of its supply coming from foreign sources. This vulnerability has significant implications for national security, as disruptions to the supply chain can have far-reaching consequences for industries that rely on these minerals. The Critical Minerals Ministerial aims to address this issue by promoting international cooperation and coordination on the development of sustainable and secure supply chains for critical minerals.
