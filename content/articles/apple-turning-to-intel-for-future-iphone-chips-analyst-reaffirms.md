## Introduction
In a move that could potentially shake up the global semiconductor industry, **Apple** is rumored to be partnering with **Intel** for future iPhone chip manufacturing. According to industry analysts, **Apple** is expected to start using **Intel**-produced chips in its iPhones by 2027. This move could reduce **Apple**'s reliance on **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)**, which has been the primary manufacturer of **Apple**'s iPhone chips. The news has sent shockwaves through the tech industry, with many wondering what this means for the future of **Apple**'s devices.

## Background & Context
**Apple** has been using **TSMC** as its primary chip manufacturer for several years, but the company has been looking to diversify its supply chain. **Intel**, on the other hand, has been trying to expand its contract manufacturing business, and a partnership with **Apple** could be a major win for the company. The partnership is expected to start with **Intel** producing **M-Series** chips for **Apple**, which are used in the company's Mac computers. However, it's likely that **Intel** will also produce chips for **Apple**'s iPhones and other devices in the future.

The news of the partnership comes as **Apple** is facing increasing pressure to reduce its reliance on **TSMC**, which is based in Taiwan. The company has been looking to diversify its supply chain in recent years, and a partnership with **Intel** could be a strategic move to achieve this goal. **Intel** has been investing heavily in its contract manufacturing business, and a partnership with **Apple** could be a major win for the company.

## Analysis
The partnership between **Apple** and **Intel** could have significant implications for the global semiconductor industry. **Apple** is one of the largest consumers of semiconductors in the world, and a partnership with **Intel** could give the company more control over its supply chain. This could also lead to more competition in the semiconductor industry, as other companies look to partner with **Intel** or other contract manufacturers.

For **US** citizens, the partnership could also have significant implications. **Intel** is a **US**-based company, and a partnership with **Apple** could lead to more jobs and investment in the **US** semiconductor industry. Additionally, the partnership could also lead to more innovation and competition in the industry, which could benefit **US** consumers.

## Quotes & Reactions
"We believe that **Apple**'s decision to partner with **Intel** is a strategic move to diversify its supply chain," said **Patrick Moorhead**, an analyst at **Moor Insights & Strategy**. "This partnership could give **Apple** more control over its supply chain and reduce its reliance on **TSMC**."

"**Intel** has been investing heavily in its contract manufacturing business, and a partnership with **Apple** could be a major win for the company," said **Stacy Rasgon**, an analyst at **Bernstein Research**. "This partnership could also lead to more competition in the semiconductor industry, which could benefit **US** consumers."

## Outlook
The partnership between **Apple** and **Intel** is expected to start by 2027, with **Intel** producing **M-Series** chips for **Apple**. However, it's likely that **Intel** will also produce chips for **Apple**'s iPhones and other devices in the future. The partnership could have significant implications for the global semiconductor industry, and could lead to more competition and innovation in the industry.

As the partnership between **Apple** and **Intel** moves forward, it will be interesting to see how it affects the global semiconductor industry. Will other companies look to partner with **Intel** or other contract manufacturers? How will **TSMC** respond to **Apple**'s decision to partner with **Intel**?
