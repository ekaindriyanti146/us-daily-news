The festival has a long history of promoting cultural exchange and understanding, and has been a platform for filmmakers to showcase their work and connect with audiences from around the world. However, the festival's silence on the **Gaza** conflict has been criticized by many in the film industry, who see it as a failure to use its platform to raise awareness about important global issues. 

The conflict in **Gaza**, which has been ongoing for many years, has resulted in the deaths of thousands of people, including civilians, children, and women.
