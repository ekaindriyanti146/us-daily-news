## Introduction
The **SpaceX Crew-12** mission has successfully docked at the **International Space Station (ISS)**, marking a significant milestone in the partnership between **NASA** and **SpaceX**. The crew, consisting of four astronauts, launched from **Kennedy Space Center** on a **SpaceX Crew Dragon** spacecraft and arrived at the ISS after a journey of several hours. The mission is part of **NASA's Commercial Crew Program**, which aims to develop and operate crew vehicles to transport astronauts to and from the ISS. The successful docking of the Crew-12 mission is a major achievement for **SpaceX** and **NASA**, and marks a new era in space exploration and cooperation between space agencies and private companies.

## Background & Context
The **SpaceX Crew-12** mission is the latest in a series of crewed missions to the **International Space Station (ISS)**. The ISS is a habitable artificial satellite in low Earth orbit, where astronauts and cosmonauts live and work for extended periods. The station is a joint project between **NASA**, **Roscosmos** (Russia), **JAXA** (Japan), **ESA** (Europe), and **CSA** (Canada). The **SpaceX Crew Dragon** spacecraft is a reusable crew vehicle developed by **SpaceX** under a contract with **NASA**. The spacecraft is designed to carry astronauts to and from the ISS, and has been used for several crewed missions since its first launch in 2020. The **Crew-12** mission is the latest in a series of missions aimed at relieving the previous crew and conducting scientific experiments during their stay on the ISS.

### Mission Objectives
