The international community has been watching the situation closely, with many calling for the Pakistani government to ensure that Khan receives adequate medical care. The situation has also sparked a debate about the role of politics in Pakistan, with many arguing that the country's leaders are more interested in consolidating power than in addressing the needs of their citizens.
