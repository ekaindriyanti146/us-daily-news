The lawsuit alleges that **Hims & Hers** has been selling copycat versions of **Wegovy**, which **Novo Nordisk** claims infringe on its intellectual property rights. This move comes as **Hims & Hers** announced its decision to retreat from the production of compounded GLP-1 pills, a key ingredient in **Wegovy**. The **FDA** has also announced plans to take "decisive steps" against GLP-1 compounds, further complicating the situation for **Hims & Hers**.

## Background & Context

The drug, which is administered via injection, has been shown to be highly effective in helping individuals lose weight and improve their overall health. **Novo Nordisk**, a Danish multinational pharmaceutical company, has invested heavily in the development and marketing of **Wegovy**, which has become one of its top-selling products.

However, the success of **Wegovy** has also attracted the attention of rival companies, including **Hims & Hers**, which has been selling a compounded version of the GLP-1 pill. **Hims & Hers**, a telehealth company, has been marketing its version of the pill as a more affordable alternative to **Wegovy**.
