## Introduction
The latest film adaptation of **Emily Brontë**'s classic novel, **Wuthering Heights**, has taken the box office by storm, earning $3 million in previews on Valentine's Day. The film, which stars **Jacob Elordi** as **Heathcliff**, has been generating buzz for its unique take on the classic story, with a focus on the intense and passionate relationship between **Heathcliff** and **Catherine**. With its strong preview performance, **Wuthering Heights** is expected to dominate the box office this weekend, leaving other films, including **GOAT**, in its wake.

## Background & Context
**Wuthering Heights** is a classic novel that has been adapted into numerous film and stage productions over the years. The story, which follows the tumultuous relationship between **Heathcliff** and **Catherine**, has captivated audiences for generations with its themes of love, revenge, and tragedy. The latest film adaptation, which was directed by **William Wyler**, has been praised for its faithful interpretation of the novel, as well as its stunning cinematography and performances. However, the film has also been criticized for its changes to the original story, including a new ending that deviates from the novel.

### Controversy Surrounding the Film
The film has been surrounded by controversy, with some critics arguing that it does not stay true to the original novel. The new ending, in particular, has been a point of contention, with some fans of the book feeling that it alters the tone and message of the story. However, the film's director and cast have defended the changes, arguing that they were necessary to make the story feel fresh and relevant to modern audiences.

## Analysis
The success of **Wuthering Heights** is a significant indicator of the film's potential to resonate with audiences. The film's preview performance is particularly impressive, given that it was released on a weekday, and it suggests that the film has a strong chance of performing well over the Valentine's Day weekend. The film's themes of love and passion are well-suited to the holiday, and its unique take on the classic story is likely to appeal to fans of the novel and newcomers alike.

### Box Office Performance
The box office performance of **Wuthering Heights** is expected to be strong, with some predictions suggesting that it could earn up to $20 million over the Valentine's Day weekend. This would make it one of the top-grossing films of the weekend, and would be a significant achievement for a film that has been surrounded by controversy. **GOAT**, which earned $1 million in previews, is also expected to perform well, but it is unlikely to match the success of **Wuthering Heights**.
