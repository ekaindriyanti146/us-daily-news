## Background & Context
The conflict between Israel and Gaza has been ongoing for decades, with periods of relative calm punctuated by outbreaks of violence. The latest escalation is believed to be in response to rocket attacks from Gaza, which have been launched by militant groups. The Israeli military has been carrying out air strikes on Gaza in an effort to target these groups and prevent further attacks.

However, the air strikes have also killed civilians, including children and police officers. The use of air power in densely populated areas has raised concerns about the proportionality of the response and the potential for civilian casualties. The international community has called for a ceasefire and an end to the violence, but a lasting resolution to the conflict remains elusive.

The situation in Gaza is complex, with a range of factors contributing to the violence. The blockade of Gaza, which has been in place since 2007, has had a devastating impact on the economy and living standards. The lack of access to basic necessities, such as food, water, and healthcare, has created a humanitarian crisis.

### History of the Conflict
The conflict between Israel and Gaza has its roots in the early 20th century, when Jewish immigrants began to arrive in Palestine. The establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, who were forced to flee their homes and seek refuge in neighboring countries.

Since then, the conflict has been marked by periods of violence and relative calm. The Israeli military has carried out numerous operations in Gaza, including ground invasions and air strikes. The militant groups in Gaza have launched rocket attacks on Israel, which have been met with a military response.
