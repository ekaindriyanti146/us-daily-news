## Background & Context
The tariffs in question were imposed by **Trump** under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which grants the President broad authority to regulate international trade in times of national emergency. The tariffs were aimed at protecting US industries, particularly the steel and aluminum sectors. However, the move was met with widespread criticism from European leaders, who argued that the tariffs were unfair and would harm their economies.

The Supreme Court ruling has struck down the tariffs, citing that **Trump**'s use of the IEEPA was unconstitutional. The ruling has been hailed as a victory for European leaders, who have been seeking clarity on the next steps. The **European Union** has been urging **Trump** to reconsider his trade policies and work towards a more cooperative approach.
