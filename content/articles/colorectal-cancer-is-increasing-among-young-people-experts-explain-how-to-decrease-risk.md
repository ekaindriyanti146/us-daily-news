## Introduction
Colorectal cancer, also known as colon cancer, is a type of cancer that affects the large intestine. It is one of the most common types of cancer in the United States, and its incidence is increasing among young people. According to recent reports, colorectal cancer is now the top cancer killer in Americans under 50. This trend has raised concerns among health experts, who are working to understand the causes of the increase and to develop effective strategies for prevention and treatment. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind the rising incidence of colorectal cancer in young people, and what can be done to reduce the risk of developing this disease.

## Background & Context
Colorectal cancer is a complex disease that is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. The exact causes of the increase in colorectal cancer among young people are not yet fully understood, but several factors are thought to contribute to the trend. These include:
* **Diet**: A diet high in processed meat, sugar, and saturated fat, and low in fiber, fruits, and vegetables, may increase the risk of colorectal cancer.
* **Lifestyle**: A sedentary lifestyle, lack of exercise, and obesity may also contribute to the development of colorectal cancer.
* **Genetic predisposition**: Some people may be more susceptible to colorectal cancer due to their genetic makeup.
* **Other medical conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, may increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer.

## Analysis
The increasing incidence of colorectal cancer among young people has significant implications for public health. It highlights the need for greater awareness and education about the risks and symptoms of the disease, as well as the importance of early detection and screening. According to [colon cancer](/articles/colon-cancer-now-the-top-cancer-killer-in-americans-under-50), colon cancer is now the top cancer killer in Americans under 50. Furthermore, the trend underscores the importance of adopting a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and avoiding smoking.
